# Algorithms for massive datasets - Project
 


PAOLA SERRA AND GIULIA HADJIANDREA

 The project aims at enforcing a Market Basket Analysis (MBA) of old newspapers using PySpark by finding frequent itemsets.
 Two different algorithms were implemented to  perform this task: A-Priori Algorithm and the first complete pass of Toivonen algorithm.
 In the first section of the report we describe the dataset, then we explain the pre-processing phase we performed to clean the records and tokenize texts. 
 In the last part we explain the implemented algorithms and show the results.
